/**
 * Opens the temple arms on their hinges so they clear the head.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A frame's arms are modelled straight, at roughly the width of
 * the frame front. A head is wider than that: measured on one real model, the
 * arms sit 166 mm apart while the head is 190 mm across at its widest, so the
 * arms run INSIDE the skull from about 60 mm behind the frame front. The
 * occluder then does its job and hides them, and a merchant sees an arm that
 * stops dead just past the hinge.
 *
 * Real eyewear solves this physically: you put the glasses on and the temples
 * flex outward at the hinge. This does the same thing, and nothing more. Each
 * arm is reparented under a pivot placed at its own hinge and ROTATED as a rigid
 * body -- no vertex is moved relative to any other, so the merchant's geometry,
 * silhouette and detail survive exactly as modelled.
 *
 * That is the difference from the per-vertex clearance pass this replaces. That
 * one worked, but it rewrote the model to get there: 11.4% of one model's temple
 * vertices displaced by up to 27.6 mm.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT ENFORCED. Only the span from the hinge back to the widest point of
 * the head -- the ear line. Behind that the arm is hooking in behind the ear and
 * BELONGS inside the head silhouette; that is what lets the occluder hide the
 * tip. Pushing the hook out too would trade this bug for the temple-tip bug.
 *
 * The solve is pure geometry and takes plain numbers, so the angle can be tested
 * without a renderer or a scene.

 * -- so a "front quarter" line lands behind the actual front assembly and misses

/**
 * How far each temple is opened, radians.

 * A measured constant, and deliberately not a solve. What it has to beat is not
 * lateral penetration -- it is the GRAZING band where the arm runs nearly
 * tangent to the occluder near the face's silhouette, where a millimetre of
 * depth hides thirty pixels of arm. The geometric solve this replaced modelled
 * the problem as lateral clearance against the head's width profile, asked for
 * 14-25 degrees, and saturated its own cap on all three models. That is 3-5x
 * the truth, and past about 8 degrees the arm stops being helped and starts
 * coming apart -- the tip swings clear of the shell and is never hidden again.
 *
 * Swept on all three merchant models against the head-frame end metric (no
 * outward shift anywhere in the sweep, 25-frame turn to +/-53 degrees):
 *
 *   angle      0      3      5      8     11    14.32

 *   (* failures at 8+ are 54-71 px holes: the arm coming apart)
 *
 * The three windows intersect at 3-5, so this sits in the middle of it. Being
 * an ANGLE is also why it needs no head-size term: the band it clears subtends
 * roughly the same angle on any head, where the outward SHIFT it replaced had
 * to be scaled by head width and still only suited the head it was tuned on.
 *
 * Note what the numbers say about the OLD value, 14.32 degrees: 0/8 on every
 * model. It was not a near miss. It was chosen against a screen-space metric
 * that paid for stand-off -- see occlusionProbe's earGapRatio.
